## Manual Testing 

### User Stories

#### First Time Visitor Goals

- To look for inspiration in joining a MMA gym, that reassures and welcomes newcomers to the sport.  
  - This is achieved with the why-join section on the index page, which details a few of many benefits of joining the gym. [View](https://github.com/JCook22/hs-mma/blob/main/assets/images/why-join.png)
- To quickly find out what classes are available, so I can check my favourite martial arts are included.
  - This is achieved with the classes timetable, easily located using the navbar. It details all classes offered and the times. [View](https://github.com/JCook22/hs-mma/blob/main/assets/images/classes-timetable.png)
- To find contact information for the gym, so I can make enquiries.
  - This is achieved with the contact details section of the footer, to ensure it's always easy to find. [View](https://github.com/JCook22/hs-mma/blob/main/assets/images/contact-details.png)
- To easily sign up for a membership, without too many fields or unnecessary questions.
  - This is achieved with the sign up form, which was intentionally kept simple for the user. They answer a few basic questions and the staff will contact them to finish the process and create a bespoke plan. [View](https://github.com/JCook22/hs-mma/blob/main/assets/images/sign-up-formv2.png)

#### Returning Visitor Goals

- To look at class times, so that I don't miss a session or can train in another martial art.
  - This is achieved with the classes timetable, it ensures it is simple to check when class is scheduled and shows the user all other available options. [View](https://github.com/JCook22/hs-mma/blob/main/assets/images/classes-timetable.png)
- To keep up to date with any changes or additions to classes, so I can make the most of my membership.
  - This is also achieved with the classes timetable, it will be updated as changes are made so that members always know the latest options available to them. [View](https://github.com/JCook22/hs-mma/blob/main/assets/images/classes-timetable.png)
