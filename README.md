## Features

### Existing Features

#### Navbar

![Navbar](assets/images/navbar.png)
This is the navbar which can be found at the top of all 3 of the sites pages. The logo can be found on the left, which when clicked will also act as a link to return to the home page. The links to the other pages can be found on the right. The current page will always be underlined and when the user hovers over another of the links it will be underlined also.

#### Why Join Section

![Why-Join](assets/images/why-join.png)
This is the why join section found on the home page. The purpose of this section is to re-assure and inspire the new users with less experience to sign up and get involved with the gym.

#### Contact Details

![Contact-Details](assets/images/contact-details.png)  
This is the contact details section which can be found on the left side of the footer of all 3 pages. This ensures that regardless of what page the user is on they will be able to locate the required information, whether they need to find the address or make contact with enquiries.

#### Social Links

![Social-Links](assets/images/social-links.png)  
This is the social links section which can be found on the right side of the footer of all 3 pages. This enables the users to obtain more information from social media if that is their preferred method. Links will open in a new window.

#### Classes Timetable 

![Classes-Timetable](assets/images/classes-timetable.png)
This is the classes timetable found on the classes page. It's purpose is to showcase the variety of classes available at the gym and act as a reminder for those who attend so they don't miss a session.

#### Sign Up Form

![Sign-Up-Form](assets/images/sign-up-form.png)  
This is the sign up form found on the sign up page. This allows new users to enter their personal information so they can enrol with the gym. For now it is limited to requesting a chat with an advisor at the gym, so the staff and visitor can work on creating their bespoke membership plan.

### Features Left to Implement

#### Gallery

A possible feature would be a gallery page which could effectively showcase the location and classes that the gym has to offer. This could reduce any fears or doubts felt by new users and possibly encourage them to take part and sign up.

#### Dynamic Classes Timetable

In the future it would be much more efficient if the classes timetable was directly linked to a database, this would allow for real-time changes to the timetable without having to manually adjust the tables contents.

#### Sign In Feature

Another interesting feature would be to allow users to create accounts and sign in upon visiting the site. This would have a lot of benefits; such as being able to link your account to the specific classes you attend so you can receive relevant updates, connect with other users, enhance visibility of classes already enrolled in and many more.
